# Make Your App Material
Transform a functional newsreader app using material design techniques.

This project gives you an opportunity to improve an app’s design, a vital skill for building apps users will love. It also replicates a common developer task of updating and changing an app's design as new standards are released.

In this project, you’ll take a functional new reader app and redesign it to follow the Material Design guidelines. You’ll use user feedback to make changes to improve the UI.
